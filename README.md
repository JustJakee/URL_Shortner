# URL Shortener

A simple URL shortener application built using AWS services and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project implements a URL shortener using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and a frontend developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to input a long URL, which is then shortened using a randomly generated shortcode. Users can then use this shortcode to redirect to the original long URL.

## Features

- **Shortening URLs**: Generates a short URL for any given long URL.
- **Redirects**: Using the short URL redirects users to the original long URL.
- **Backend**: Utilizes AWS Lambda for serverless functions and DynamoDB for storing URL mappings.
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for user interaction.
